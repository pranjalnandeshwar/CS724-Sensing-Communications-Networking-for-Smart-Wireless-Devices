# Intelligent Exercise Recognition and Counting Band with IMU Sensors

## Overview

This project involves the development of a wearable exercise recognition and counting band equipped with 9-axis IMU sensors and integrated with an Arduino Nano BLE Sense. The band is designed to capture motion signals from the right shoulder, process and analyze these signals, and classify exercises in real-time. The system also includes an anomaly detection mechanism to enhance robustness and accuracy.
